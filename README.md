## 🚀 About

Welcome to **rustpocketmine**, the boldest, craziest, “did they really?” attempt at rewriting PocketMine‑MP in a language that makes PHP look like BASIC. This project is:

- **Zero percent** complete  
- **One hundred percent** ridiculous  
- **Potentially** the next big meme in the Minecraft server scene

## 🎯 Why… Rust?

> “Why rewrite in Rust?”  
> — Literally no one asked, but we did it anyway.

- **Memory safety**! Because who doesn’t love borrowing rules you still don’t fully understand?  
- **Performance**! Benchmarks say it’s fast, but nobody can find the benchmarks.  
- **Cargo**! Dependency hell has never been so… managed.
