## About the Project

**PocketMine‚ÄëRS** is our audacious‚Äîand delightfully absurd‚Äîattempt to rebuild the PocketMine‚ÄëMP server from the ground up in Rust. We aim to:

- **Zero** feature parity (for now)  
- **One hundred** percent raw ambition  
- **Infinite** meme fodder for the community  

Born out of a caffeine‚Äëfueled brainstorming session (and a questionable moral compass), this project exists to answer the question: ‚ÄúWhat if we did everything in Rust?‚Äù Spoiler: some things probably shouldn‚Äôt be.

## Why Rust?

> ‚ÄúWhy rewrite PocketMine‚ÄëMP in Rust?‚Äù  
> ‚Äî Approximately 42 confused developers

1. **Memory Safety**  
   - Rust‚Äôs borrow checker prevents data races‚Äîuntil we inevitably sprinkle `unsafe`.  
2. **Performance**  
   - Zero‚Äëcost abstractions let us brag about 0.01% TPS improvements.  
3. **Modern Ecosystem**  
   - Cargo: part miracle, part existential dread.  
4. **Developer Masochism**  
   - Advanced type‚Äëlevel programming is the new Sudoku.

---

## Vision & Mission

- **Vision:** Deliver the most memory‚Äësafe Minecraft server that still crashes in spectacular (and comedic) fashion.  
- **Mission:** Fuse Rust‚Äôs fearless concurrency model with a real‚Äëtime game engine, interspersed with enough compile‚Äëtime checks to keep us employed.

---

## Deep Architectural Dive

### Async Reactor Core

- **Custom MIO/Epoll Hybrid**  
  Orchestrates events across threads with zero‚Äëcost futures.  
- **Task Scheduler**  
  Prioritizes I/O‚Äëheavy tasks while ignoring panic‚Äëinducers.  
- **Plugin Hooks**  
  Instrument entry/exit points for maximum extensibility.

### Protocol Stack

- **Bedrock Protocol v1.x**  
  Full reimplementation, no half measures.  
- **Type‚ÄëLevel Guarantees**  
  Compile‚Äëtime validity for every packet (mostly).  
- **Compression & Encryption**  
  GZIP plus our proprietary ‚ÄúRust Obfuscation‚Ñ¢‚Äù.

### Plugin Ecosystem

- **WASM Modules**  
  Write plugins in any language that compiles to WASM (yes, including Brainfuck).  
- **Rust DSL**  
  Embedded domain‚Äëspecific language for game logic‚Äîdocs coming soon‚Ñ¢.  
- **PHP Bridge**  
  Experimental compatibility layer; sacrifices semicolons for soul.

### Storage & Persistence

- **CRDT‚ÄëBased Chunk Sync**  
  Guarantees eventual consistency‚Äîchaos optional.  
- **Transactional BTreeMap**  
  Powered by `DroppableCell` locks for ‚Äúsafety‚Äù.  
- **RDBMS Integrations**  
  Experimental SQLite and Postgres backends‚Äîhandle with care.

### Metrics & Observability

- **Prometheus Exporter**  
  Metrics in alpha, subject to brokenness.  
- **Tracing with `tracing` Crate**  
  Capture spans‚Äîand tears‚Äîduring debugging.  
- **Structured Logging**  
  JSON logs by default, because humans love parsing JSON.

## Core Pillars & Design Principles

| Pillar                         | Principle                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîí **Safety First**            | Borrow checker is our gatekeeper‚Äîjust don‚Äôt ask about `unsafe`.     |
| ‚ö° **Performance Obsession**    | Microbenchmarks no one reads, but we brag anyway.                  |
| üß© **Unbreakable Extensibility**| Hooks, events, and callbacks everywhere‚Äîstrap in.                   |
| üí° **Relentless Experimentation**| We merge feature branches into `main` and pray nothing explodes.    |

## What the PMMP Devs Are Saying

> **@dktapps (Dylan)**  
> ‚ÄúI juggle this project alongside three cats and a day job. Please be gentle.‚Äù

> **@shoghicp (Shoghi Cervantes)**  
> ‚ÄúPHP earned its stripes for a reason; don‚Äôt make me debug your Rust.‚Äù

> **PMMP CI Bot**  
> ‚Äúüö® Build failed: too many epicycles in the networking layer.‚Äù

> **The Community**  
> *‚ÄúThis is either genius or madness‚Ä¶ definitely both.‚Äù*

---

## Getting Started

1. **Install Rust**  
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. **Clone & Build**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourorg/PocketMine-RS.git
   cd PocketMine-RS
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. **Run the Server**  
   ```bash
   ./target/release/pocketmine-rs --port 19132 --max-players 42
   ```
4. **Connect**  
   Point your Bedrock client at `localhost:19132` and prepare for existential dread.

## Development Workflow

- **Branching Model**  
  - `main`: Bleeding‚Äëedge insanity  
  - `dev`: Somewhat stable chaos  
  - Feature branches: Playground of doom  

- **Code Reviews**  
  - Require at least one sarcastic comment per PR.  
  - API changes demand a haiku in the description.  

- **CI/CD**  
  - GitHub Actions runs `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and our Tears Collector.  
  - Builds must pass before merging‚Äîotherwise, buyer‚Äôs remorse.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Automated Tests**  
  - Unit, integration, and property‚Äëbased tests (mostly passing).  
- **Fuzzing**  
  - Uses `cargo-fuzz` to uncover panics and hilarious edge cases.  
- **Benchmark Suite**  
  - Microbenchmarks under review (performance claims subject to verification).

---

## Roadmap & Milestones

- **v0.0.1-alpha** (Q2 2025)  
  - Networking MVP  
  - Player join/quit events  
  - First official memeworthy meltdown

## FAQ

**Q: Will this ever be stable?**  
A: Stability is a social construct. We prefer chaos.

**Q: Can I write plugins in PHP?**  
A: Only if you bribe the Macro Magician.

**Q: Does it actually work?**  
A: It compiles. That‚Äôs half the battle.
