# PocketMine-RS 🦀🚀

> "Me and my team of highly trained Rustaceans™ have finally done what no sane developer would attempt: rewriting PocketMine-MP in Rust. Why? Because PHP wasn’t giving us enough compile-time existential crises."

# DISCLAIMER:
Everything is from [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP), please rate start to the original project and without it we couldn't make this done.

## About the Project

**PocketMine‑RS** is the most ambitious, unnecessary, and totally epic rewrite of PocketMine‑MP you never asked for. We decided PHP wasn’t giving us enough headaches, so we ported everything into a language where the compiler is smarter than us.

This project is:

- **0% complete**
- **100% serious** (seriously joking)
- **∞% chaos**

The idea came to life during a 3AM voice call when someone said, "wouldn’t it be funny if...?" Spoiler: it was.

## Why Rust?

> “Why not write it in JavaScript?” — A banned user

1. **Memory Safety**  
   Rust ensures you can’t shoot yourself in the foot—unless you try really hard. Then it’ll compile and shoot you in the face instead.  
2. **Performance**  
   So fast it outruns your motivation to finish the project.  
3. **Modern Ecosystem**  
   Cargo makes dependency hell a fun little weekend escape.  
4. **Developer Therapy**  
   Nothing beats the emotional rollercoaster of pleasing the borrow checker.

## Vision & Mission

- **Vision:** A memory-safe, multithreaded, async-enabled Bedrock server that sometimes boots.  
- **Mission:** Build the most over-engineered Minecraft server of all time and pretend it’s for performance.

---

## Deep Architectural Dive

### Async Reactor Core

- **Custom Event Reactor**: Built entirely on `tokio`, duct tape, and misplaced optimism.  
- **Task Scheduler**: Randomizes which async tasks run first for that authentic chaos vibe.  
- **Hot-Swappable Panic Hooks**: Because you never know when your runtime will just... give up.

### Protocol Stack

- **Bedrock Protocol v1.x-ish**: Inspired by the official protocol, but with more comments that say "???".  
- **Packet Parser**: Validates data like a strict librarian with a taser.  
- **Compression**: Supports GZIP and developer tears.

### Plugin Ecosystem

- **WASM Plugins**: Because nothing screams extensibility like trying to debug a WASM panic in Rust.  
- **Rusty Scripting DSL**: Currently just `println!("Hello plugin world!")`, but dream big.  
- **PHP Bridge**: We sacrificed a goat to make this work. It didn’t.

### Storage & Persistence

- **Chunk Storage**: Implemented using Schrödinger’s serialization—it both works and doesn’t.  
- **Persistence Engine**: Saves data on a quantum level (may or may not be real).  
- **Experimental DB Support**: Now with 97% more SQL injection resistance!

### Metrics & Observability

- **Prometheus**: If it works, it exports. If not, it still exports (errors).  
- **Tracing**: You can trace execution all the way to the root of your poor life choices.  
- **Logs**: Output in JSON, YAML, Morse code, and interpretive dance.

## Core Pillars & Design Principles

| Pillar                         | Principle                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 **Safety Last**            | `unsafe` is just another word for spicy.     |
| ⚡ **Speedrun Development**    | Who needs tests when you can YOLO deploy?                  |
| 🧩 **Extensibility++**| Every part is modular, replaceable, and unstable.                   |
| 💡 **Experimental All The Way**| If it compiles, ship it. If it doesn’t, compile harder.    |

## What the PMMP Devs Are Saying

> **@dktapps**  
> "This is either a prank or a cry for help."

> **@shoghicp (Shoghi Cervantes)**  
> "When I said 'rewrite PMMP,' I didn’t mean like this."

> **@intyre**  
> “I read the code. I cried.”

> **PMMP Discord Moderator**  
> "Stop tagging me about this."

## Getting Started

1. **Install Rust**  
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
2. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sauoro/PocketMine-RS.git
   cd PocketMine-RS
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. **Run the Server**  
   ```bash
   ./target/release/pocketmine-rs --port 19132 --max-players 10
   ```
4. **Regret Everything**  
   Start Minecraft Bedrock. Connect. Watch it maybe work.

## Development Workflow

- **Branching Model**:  
  - `main`: For brave souls only.  
  - `dev`: Slightly less cursed.  
  - `panic-hotfix-*`: Used frequently.

- **Code Reviews**:  
  - PRs must include one meme and a bug fix. Preferably unrelated.  

- **CI/CD**:  
  - GitHub Actions, Travis, Jenkins, and probably a hamster wheel.

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests**: Every function tested. Except the broken ones.  
- **Fuzzing**: Because "expected behavior" is just a suggestion.  
- **Benchmarking**: Fast. Probably. We haven't checked.

---

## Roadmap & Milestones

- **v0.0.1-alpha**: Accepts connections and occasionally logs them.  
- **v0.1.0-beta**: Commands maybe work. Don’t quote us.  
- **v1.0.0**: Achieves sentience and forks itself.

---

## Community & Support

- **Discord**: Join for moral support and mutual debugging trauma. [Discord](https://discord.gg/hSTcSRcNcQ) 
- **GitHub Issues**: Please scream responsibly.

## FAQ

**Q: Why does it exist?**  
A: Because no one stopped us in time.

**Q: Can I use it in production?**  
A: You can use _anything_ in production if you're bold enough.

**Q: How stable is it?**  
A: It's stable... in the sense that it fails consistently.

## License & Credits

- **License**: MIT — because we legally can’t stop you.  
- **Credits**:  
  - The PMMP devs, for giving us something beautiful to parody  
  - The Rust community, for enabling our hubris  
  - You, for reading this far. You’re the real MVP.
